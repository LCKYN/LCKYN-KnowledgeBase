1. **Artificial Intelligence & LLMs**

- **Generative AI Patterns:** RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), Agentic Workflows, and Multi-agent Orchestration.
- **Model Optimization:** Quantization (GGUF/EXL2), LoRA/QLoRA Fine-tuning, and Speculative Decoding.
- **Evaluation Frameworks:** LLM-as-a-judge, RAGAS metrics, and custom evaluation benchmarks.

2. **Machine Learning Engineering (Non-LLM)**

- **Advanced Algorithms:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Time-series Forecasting (Foundation Models), and Tabular Transformers.
- **XAI (Explainable AI):** SHAP, LIME, and Integrated Gradients for model transparency.
- **Validation:** Backtesting strategies, Cross-validation for non-stationary data, and A/B Testing design.

3. **MLOps & LLMOps (The "Cookbook" Recipes)**

- **MLflow Mastery:** Tracking experiments, Model Registry, and MLflow Deployment patterns.
- **CI/CD for ML:** Automated testing for data/models and GitHub Actions for ML pipelines.
- **Observability:** Monitoring Data Drift, Concept Drift, and LLM Hallucinations in production.

4. **Scalable Infrastructure**

- **Containerization:** Advanced Docker (Multi-stage builds, GPU-support) and Compose for local orchestration.
- **Kubernetes (K8s):** Basic manifests (Pods, Deployments, Services) and Kubeflow for ML workflows.
- **Vector Databases:** Scaling and benchmarking Pinecone, Weaviate, or Milvus.

5. **System Architecture & Cost Management**

- **System Design:** Designing for Low Latency (Caching, Async Processing) and High Availability.
- **Financial Ops (FinOps):**
    - **CapEx vs. OpEx:** Hardware depreciation vs. Cloud consumption models.
    - **Unit Economics:** Cost per Inference, Token-cost optimization, and GPU spot instance strategies.

6. **Strategic Data Leadership**

- **Data Governance:** Data Quality (Great Expectations), Privacy (GDPR/PDPA), and Ethic Frameworks.
- **Business Impact:** KPI Mapping (Technical metrics to Revenue/Savings) and Stakeholder Management.
- **Project Post-mortems:** Lessons learned from failed/successful deployments (The "Senior" edge).

7. **Personal Code Snippets (The "Scrapbook")**

- **Boilerplates:** PyTorch Lightning templates, LangChain/LlamaIndex wrappers, and K8s YAML snippets.
- **Utils:** Data cleaning scripts, visualization helpers (Plotly/Streamlit), and SQL optimization tricks.
