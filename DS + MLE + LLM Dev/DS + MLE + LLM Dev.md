[[1. Artificial Intelligence & LLMs]]: Building advanced systems using Large Language Models, focusing on RAG, fine-tuning, and autonomous agent workflows.

[[2. Machine Learning Engineering (Non-LLM)]]: Applying traditional ML models (Tabular, Vision, Time-series) with an emphasis on explainability (XAI) and rigorous validation.

[[3. MLOps & LLMOps]]: Managing the end-to-end model lifecycle, including experiment tracking with MLflow, automated CI/CD pipelines, and real-time monitoring.

[[4. Scalable Infrastructure]]: Leveraging Docker and Kubernetes to deploy resilient AI services and managing high-dimensional data with Vector Databases.

[[5. System Architecture & Cost Management]]: Designing high-performance systems while optimizing financial metrics like CapEx (hardware) and OpEx (API/Token costs).

[[6. Strategic Data Leadership]]: Bridging technical output with business value, ensuring data quality, and leading AI strategy through impactful communication.

[[7. Personal Code Snippets]]: A reusable library of "battle-tested" code, templates, and scripts to accelerate development and ensure consistency across projects.
