[[Machine Learning Engineering (Non-LLM)]]: Applying traditional ML models (Tabular, Vision, Time-series) with an emphasis on explainability (XAI) and rigorous validation.

[[MLOps & LLMOps]]: Managing the end-to-end model lifecycle, including experiment tracking with MLflow, automated CI/CD pipelines, and real-time monitoring.

[[Scalable Infrastructure]]: Leveraging Docker and Kubernetes to deploy resilient AI services and managing high-dimensional data with Vector Databases.

[[System Architecture & Cost Management]]: Designing high-performance systems while optimizing financial metrics like CapEx (hardware) and OpEx (API/Token costs).

[[Strategic Data Leadership]]: Bridging technical output with business value, ensuring data quality, and leading AI strategy through impactful communication.

[[Personal Code Snippets]]: A reusable library of "battle-tested" code, templates, and scripts to accelerate development and ensure consistency across projects.
