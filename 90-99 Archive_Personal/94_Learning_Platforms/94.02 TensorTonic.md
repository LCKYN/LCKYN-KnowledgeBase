## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 200+ algorithms | Comprehensive coverage from basics to advanced |
| Interactive visualizations | Visual math and algorithm explanations |
| From-scratch implementation | Build understanding by coding yourself |
| Research paper guides | Learn to implement published papers |
| Progressive difficulty | Gradients → Neural nets → Transformers |

## Learning Path

| Stage | Topics |
|-------|--------|
| Foundations | Gradients, backpropagation, optimization |
| Classical ML | Linear models, trees, SVMs, clustering |
| Deep Learning | CNNs, RNNs, attention mechanisms |
| Advanced | Transformers, diffusion models, RLHF |

## Use Cases

- **Deep understanding** - Learn "why" not just "how" of ML
- **Interview prep** - Explain algorithms at implementation level
- **Research skills** - Practice implementing papers from scratch
- **Math intuition** - Visual understanding of mathematical concepts

> [!TIP] Learning Strategy
> Start with gradient descent visualization before moving to neural networks—understanding optimization is key to everything else.
