# Introduction to Design and Analysis of Algorithms

**Author**: Anany Levitin

Classic textbook covering algorithm design techniques, complexity analysis, and problem-solving strategies with practical examples.

## Key Topics

| Category | Algorithms/Concepts |
|----------|---------------------|
| Algorithm Design | Brute force, divide & conquer, greedy, dynamic programming |
| Graph Algorithms | Traversal, shortest paths, MST, topological sorting |
| Complexity Analysis | Big-O notation, recurrence relations, space-time tradeoffs |
| Advanced Topics | Backtracking, branch & bound, transform & conquer |
| String Processing | Pattern matching, tries, suffix trees |

## Core Concepts

- **Design paradigms** - Systematic approaches to algorithm creation
- **Mathematical rigor** - Proof techniques and correctness verification
- **Efficiency analysis** - Time/space complexity with asymptotic notation
- **Problem-solving patterns** - Recognizing when to apply specific techniques

> [!TIP] Learning Approach
> Focus on understanding the design paradigm (why it works) before memorizing specific algorithms—patterns transfer across problems.
