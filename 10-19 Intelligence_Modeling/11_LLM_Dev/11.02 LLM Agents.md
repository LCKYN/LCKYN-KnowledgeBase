# LLM Agents

## Overview
LLM agents are autonomous systems that leverage large language models to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. They extend beyond simple prompt-response interactions by incorporating reasoning, planning, and tool use.

## Core Components

### 1. Agent Loop
- **Perception**: Process input and current state
- **Reasoning**: Use LLM to analyze and plan
- **Action**: Execute chosen action (tool call, response, etc.)
- **Observation**: Receive feedback from environment

### 2. Memory Systems
- **Short-term**: Conversation context, working memory
- **Long-term**: Vector databases, knowledge graphs
- **Episodic**: Past interactions and experiences

### 3. Planning Capabilities
- **ReAct**: Reasoning + Acting in interleaved manner
- **[[11.13 Chain of Thought|Chain-of-Thought]]**: Step-by-step reasoning
- **Tree-of-Thoughts**: Exploring multiple reasoning paths
- **Plan-and-Execute**: Separate planning from execution

## Agent Architectures

### ReAct Agent
```
Thought: I need to find information about X
Action: search[X]
Observation: [search results]
Thought: Based on results, I should...
Action: [next action]
```

### Autonomous Agent Patterns
- **Goal-driven**: Given high-level objective, decompose and execute
- **Reflexive**: Simple stimulus-response patterns
- **Deliberative**: Complex reasoning before action
- **Hybrid**: Combine reactive and deliberative approaches

## Tools & Capabilities
- Search engines and retrievers
- Code interpreters
- API calls and integrations
- Database queries
- File operations

## Frameworks
- **LangChain/LangGraph**: Agent orchestration
- **AutoGPT**: Autonomous task execution
- **BabyAGI**: Task-driven autonomous agent
- **MetaGPT**: Multi-agent collaboration

## Challenges
- **Reliability**: Ensuring consistent behavior
- **Safety**: Preventing harmful actions
- **Cost**: Managing API calls and token usage
- **Hallucination**: Maintaining factual accuracy
- **Tool misuse**: Proper tool selection and use

## Best Practices
1. Clear system prompts with role definition
2. Constrain action space appropriately
3. Implement robust error handling
4. Add human-in-the-loop for critical actions
5. Monitor and log agent behavior
6. Set iteration/token limits
