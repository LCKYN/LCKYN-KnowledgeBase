# Johnny.Decimal System

## Core Concept
A systematic method for organizing digital information using a numerical hierarchy. It eliminates "file-hunting" by assigning a permanent, unique address to every folder and file.

## Structure: `AA.ID` (Area.Category.ID)

- **Areas (AA):** Broad top-level categories (e.g., `10-19`, `20-29`). We use ranges of ten to group related topics and leave gaps for future expansion.
- **Categories & IDs (.ID):** Specific topics or individual files (e.g., `11.01`, `11.02`). The decimal ensures files remain in a logical, fixed order.
## Rules
1. **Two Levels Deep:** No more than two levels of folders.
2. **The Gap Strategy:** Leave gaps between Areas (e.g., 10 to 20) for future growth.
3. **Fixed IDs:** Every file has a unique decimal ID for instant search.


## Key Principles for Engineers

1. **Logical Sorting:** Using leading zeros (e.g., `.01` instead of `.1`) forces computers to sort files correctly (1-99) rather than alphabetically or by timestamp.
2. **Flat Hierarchy:** The "Rule of Two" mandates no more than two levels of folders. This ensures any file is reachable within 2-3 clicks, reducing cognitive load.
3. **Future-Proofing (The Gap Strategy):** By skipping numbers (e.g., jumping from `10` to `20`), you create "space" to insert new, unforeseen categories later without renumbering your entire vault.
4. **Instant Search:** Numerical IDs act as "shortcuts." Instead of searching for "RAG Fine-tuning Optimization," you simply search for `11.05` to find the exact document instantly.

## Proposed File Management Structure

- **50-59 Knowledge Management**
    - `51.01 Johnny.Decimal System.md`
    - `51.02 Obsidian Sync & Git Workflow.md`
    - `51.03 Zettelkasten vs MOC Methods.md`
