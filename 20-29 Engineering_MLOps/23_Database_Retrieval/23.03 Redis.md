# Redis

## Overview
**Redis** (Remote Dictionary Server) is an open-source, **in-memory** key-value data store used as a database, cache, message broker, and streaming engine. It is **single-threaded** for command execution, relying on I/O multiplexing for concurrency.

## Key Concepts
- **In-memory**: All data lives in RAM → sub-millisecond latency
- **Single-threaded execution**: One CPU core processes all commands sequentially → no lock contention, but bounded by single-core performance
- **I/O multiplexing**: Uses `epoll`/`kqueue` to handle thousands of connections on one thread
- **Persistence**: Optional RDB snapshots and AOF (Append-Only File) for durability
- **Pub/Sub**: Built-in publish/subscribe messaging
- **Lua scripting**: Atomic server-side scripts

## Data Structures

| Type | Example Use | Commands |
|---|---|---|
| **String** | Cache, counters | `SET`, `GET`, `INCR` |
| **Hash** | Object storage | `HSET`, `HGET`, `HGETALL` |
| **List** | Queues, feeds | `LPUSH`, `RPOP`, `LRANGE` |
| **Set** | Tags, unique items | `SADD`, `SMEMBERS`, `SINTER` |
| **Sorted Set** | Leaderboards, ranking | `ZADD`, `ZRANGE`, `ZRANK` |
| **Stream** | Event log, message queue | `XADD`, `XREAD`, `XGROUP` |

## Performance Characteristics

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Throughput | ~100k–200k ops/sec (single-threaded) |
| Latency | <1ms typical for simple commands |
| Max memory | Limited by available RAM |
| Clustering | Redis Cluster for horizontal sharding (16,384 hash slots) |
| Replication | Async primary-replica replication |

> [!WARNING] Single-threaded bottleneck
> Under extreme load, Redis saturates one CPU core. For multi-core utilization, use **Redis Cluster** (sharding) or consider [[23.04 Dragonfly]] (multi-threaded alternative).

## Common Use Cases
- **Caching** — TTL-based cache in front of databases
- **Session storage** — Fast user session lookups
- **Rate limiting** — `INCR` + `EXPIRE` pattern
- **Pub/Sub messaging** — Real-time notifications
- **Leaderboards** — Sorted sets with score-based ranking
- **ML feature store** — Low-latency feature serving
