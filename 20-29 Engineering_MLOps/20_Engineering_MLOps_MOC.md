# 20 Engineering & MLOps MOC

**Overview**: Infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and operational practices for production ML/LLM systems—from development environments to monitoring and observability.

## 21 Infrastructure

Cloud platforms, compute resources, and deployment environments for ML workloads.

- Kubernetes for ML
- GPU/TPU provisioning
- Container orchestration
- Serverless ML inference

## 22 MLOps & LLMOps

Lifecycle management for machine learning and LLM applications.

- Model versioning and registry
- CI/CD for ML pipelines
- Experiment tracking
- A/B testing and canary deployments
- LLM-specific operations (prompt versioning, guardrails deployment)

## 23 Database & Retrieval

Data storage and retrieval systems optimized for ML/LLM workloads.

- [[23_Database_Retrieval_MOC]]

## 24 Monitoring & Observability

Tracking model performance, drift detection, and system health.

- Model performance monitoring
- Data drift detection
- Logging and tracing for LLM calls
- Cost tracking and alerting
