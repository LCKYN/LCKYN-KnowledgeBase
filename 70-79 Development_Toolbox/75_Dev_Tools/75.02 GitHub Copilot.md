# GitHub Copilot

**GitHub Copilot** is an AI-powered code assistant that provides real-time code suggestions, chat-based help, and automated coding assistance within editors.

## Key Components

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Copilot Completions | Inline code suggestions as you type |
| Copilot Chat | Conversational AI for coding questions |
| Copilot Edits | Multi-file editing with AI |
| Copilot CLI | Terminal command suggestions |

## Effective Usage

> [!TIP] Best Practices
> - Write descriptive comments before code—Copilot uses them as context
> - Accept partial suggestions with `Cmd+→` (word) or `Tab` (full)
> - Use `Cmd+I` for inline chat to refactor selected code
> - Reference files with `#file:` in chat for context

## Chat Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/explain` | Explain selected code |
| `/fix` | Suggest fixes for errors |
| `/tests` | Generate unit tests |
| `/doc` | Generate documentation |
| `@workspace` | Query entire codebase |

## Context References

| Reference | Usage |
|-----------|-------|
| `#file:name.py` | Include specific file |
| `#selection` | Reference selected code |
| `@workspace` | Search entire workspace |
| `@terminal` | Include terminal output |

## Keyboard Shortcuts (VS Code)

| Action | Mac | Windows |
