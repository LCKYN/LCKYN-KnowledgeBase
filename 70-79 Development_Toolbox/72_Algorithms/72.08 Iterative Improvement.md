# Iterative Improvement

## Overview

**Iterative Improvement** is an algorithm design technique that starts with a feasible solution and repeatedly makes small changes to improve it until no further improvement is possible. Unlike greedy (which builds solution step-by-step), this refines an existing complete solution.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Feasible Solution** | Starting point that satisfies all constraints |
| **Neighborhood** | Set of solutions reachable by one local change |
| **Local Optimum** | No neighbor is better (may not be global optimum) |
| **Improvement Step** | Single modification that increases objective value |

> [!INFO] Local vs Global Optimum
> Iterative improvement finds **local optima**. For global optimum, use:
> - Multiple random restarts
> - Simulated annealing (accept worse solutions probabilistically)
> - Genetic algorithms

## Techniques

### Simplex Method (Linear Programming)

Solves: Maximize $c^T x$ subject to $Ax \leq b$, $x \geq 0$

```
1. Start at a vertex of feasible region
2. Move to adjacent vertex with better objective
3. Stop when no improving neighbor exists
```

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Average complexity | Polynomial in practice |
| Worst case | Exponential (rare) |
| Guarantee | Global optimum (convex problem) |

### Network Flow Algorithms

**Ford-Fulkerson** (Max Flow):
1. Start with zero flow
2. Find augmenting path (source → sink with residual capacity)
3. Push maximum possible flow along path
4. Repeat until no augmenting path exists

| Algorithm | Path Finding | Complexity |
|-----------|--------------|------------|
| Ford-Fulkerson | Any path (DFS) | $O(E \cdot f^*)$ where $f^*$ = max flow |
| Edmonds-Karp | BFS (shortest) | $O(VE^2)$ |
| Dinic's | Level graph + blocking flow | $O(V^2 E)$ |

### Maximum Bipartite Matching

Find largest set of non-overlapping edges between two vertex sets:

```
1. Start with empty matching
2. Find augmenting path (alternating matched/unmatched edges)
3. Flip edges along path
4. Repeat until no augmenting path
```

**Hungarian Algorithm**: $O(V^3)$ for weighted matching

### Stable Marriage Problem

**Gale-Shapley Algorithm**:
1. Each unmatched man proposes to top choice
2. Women tentatively accept best proposal, reject others
3. Rejected men propose to next choice
4. Repeat until all matched

- **Complexity**: $O(n^2)$
- **Guarantee**: Produces stable matching (no blocking pairs)

## Comparison with Other Paradigms

| Paradigm | Approach | Guarantee |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Greedy | Build incrementally, never backtrack | Often suboptimal |
| Iterative Improvement | Start complete, refine locally | Local optimum |
| Dynamic Programming | Optimal substructure | Global optimum |
| Branch and Bound | Systematic search with pruning | Global optimum |

## Practical Use Cases

- **Operations research**: Supply chain optimization, scheduling
- **ML training**: Gradient descent is iterative improvement
- **Matching markets**: Residency matching, kidney exchanges
- **Game theory**: Nash equilibrium finding
